The folder 'Project0' contains the following files:
- mysh.cpp
- Makefile
- README (this)

To run the code:
- Navigate to the directory where 'Project0' is located
- In the terminal, type 'make'
- Then, type either
      './mysh' to run the interactive shell, or
      './mysh inputTestFile' to run the shell in batch mode

About the program:
- 'mysh.cpp' launches a command line interpreter (shell), and is able to perform three built-in functions:
  - cd
  - pwd
  - exit

- The program also is able to process commands in batches, using batch mode.

Please refer to the comments in the code for further documentation.
